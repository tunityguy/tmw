##Moscow Pact

Moscow_Pact_Leader_effect: "[!Moscow_Pact_Leader]"
Moscow_Pact_Leader_desc: "The Moskovskiy Pakt, referred to in international circles as the Moscow Pact, is the Pan-European alliance of the Russian New Order. Gone is the old order of decadent states and degenerate corruption - in its place stands now European Brotherhood and Unity, guided by the Russian hegemon. The Pakt consists of many charters, detailing the economic, military and political relations of its many member states, each ultimately designed in Russian interest. With its unparalleled control over European affairs, the Pakt is truly the linchpin of European destiny - and Rossiya, the §YMaster of Europe§!."

Moscow_Pact_Member_desc: "GDP Growth Boost: §Y10%§!\n\nA §YMoskovskiy Pakt Member§! with the Rossiyskaya Federatsiya, this nation has seen the wisdom in peaceful cooperation and mutual assistance with Europe's greatest empire and joined the Moskovskiy Pakt as an equal partner. Now seen as an ally of Rossiya on the global stage, it is subject to the plethora of treaties and responsibilities the alliance subjects it to. Even though the quest for brotherly unity is stated to be the reason for membership in the Moskovskiy Pakt, it is more often than not the lure of economic prosperity and safety that draws nations into this not-so-equal relationship."

#Shanghai Pact
Shanghai_Pact_Leader: "Leader of the SCO"
Shanghai_Pact_Leader_effect: "[!Shanghai_Pact_Leader]"
Shanghai_Pact_Leader_desc: "The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, commonly referred to as "The Chinese Sphere", is an international organization of East Asian nations established during the Greater East Asia Conference in 2025. After the signing of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration during the 2025 meeting, further amendments to the Declaration formalized the Sphere's status as an international political entity with its political, economic, and military sub-organizations.\n\nBeyond its few voluntary members, the Sphere is filled with colonial governments in all but name, geared towards serving their Chinese slaveholders. Most importantly, however, it serves as a further extension of the Chinese stranglehold.\n\nAs the Permanent Chairman State of the SCO Governing Council and the Shanghai Peace Organization, we receive a significant portion of membership fees paid by Sphere members and possess the power to command the armed forces of our member states in a state of emergency. Additionally, a fraction of each subject's industrial capacities will be transferred to us, according to their level of dependency."
