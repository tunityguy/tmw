 GER_TMW_DESC:0 "Another World War, another defeat for Germany. Few have comprehended it, nearly 20 years since it happened. The brightest light that shone across Europe known as the Federal Republic of Germany was utterly extinguished in a matter of few short months.\n\nFrom the ashes of the old Germany rises an unstable and bickering regime which disagrees with itself and its own people on the future ahead. The Gods have abandoned Germany yet again, as it might have long ago were it not for her foolhardy resolution. Across the sea there lies rays of hope, but have Germany's wounds cut too deep to ever be cured?\n\nThere will always be a Germany fair, but no more shall the world love her and despair."
